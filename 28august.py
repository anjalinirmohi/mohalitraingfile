#1.map is basically used to change the data which is in the sequence
# c=[2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
# ab=map(lambda x:x+5,c)
# print(list(ab))



#2.lambda expression is basically to optimize the code
# ab=lambda x : x*2
# print(ab(2))




# y=lambda a:a*4
# print(y(10))



# y=lambda c:c*6
# print(y(90))

# 3.filter is used to filter the data in which we set the condition
c=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
ab=filter(lambda x:x%2==0,c)
print(list(ab))

# 4.reduce is used to reduce the data
# form functools import reduce
# b=[20,40,80,160,180,200]
# xy=reduce(lambda a,b: )


# global and local variable
